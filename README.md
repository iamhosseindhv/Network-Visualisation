# React-Express-Boilerplate 
Boilerplate for a react+express app, tailored to my needs.


## Usage

Step 1: clone the repository.


```
git clone https://github.com/iamhosseindhv/React-Express-boilerplate.git react-express-boilerplate
cd react-express-boilerplate
```

Step 2: install dependencies in the root of the project and `app` directory.

```
cd app && npm install && cd ../ && npm install
```

Step 3: now that you have all the dependencies, start both the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project) by following command:


```
npm run dev
```

Your app is now running on port 3000.


Open the app: `http://localhost:3000/`
